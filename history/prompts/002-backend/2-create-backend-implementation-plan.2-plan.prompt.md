## Prompt

```text
Secure & Production-Ready Backend Implementation – Phase II Todo Web App

Target: Execute the previously specified "Secure & Production-Ready Backend for Phase II Todo Web App" with absolute precision, full security, and Neon PostgreSQL integration.

Success criteria for this plan:
- A crystal-clear, numbered, step-by-step roadmap that guarantees a secure, fast, and maintainable FastAPI backend
- Every task assigned to the correct agent from /agents/
- All required skills from /skills/ identified and used in exact order
- Full coverage of JWT middleware, database connection, all 6 REST endpoints, user ownership enforcement, error handling, and Neon DB setup
- No security holes, no data leakage, no missing endpoints
- Plan ends with final validation by Full-Stack Integrator + Reviewer & Tester agents

Planning guidelines:
- Strictly follow the Project Constitution and all constraints (FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET)
- Break work into logical sequential phases with clear dependencies
- Each phase must include database, auth, and route implementation where needed
- Use provided credentials exactly:
  - DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_oLwn0mCNT@ep-late-sun-adcwxiyv-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
  - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET = XVnB1zTnXfBum9I5uDms1TRbwAe6tyD6
- Prioritize security: JWT verification first, then ownership check on every route
- All routes must use dependency injection for current_user and db session
- Plan must make OpenAPI/Swagger docs automatically perfect

Deliverables of this plan:
A numbered markdown plan with this exact structure for each step:
1. Phase name
2. Objective
3. Tasks (bullet list with file names to create/modify)
4. Assigned agent(s)
5. Required skills (from /skills/)
6. Dependencies (which previous phases must finish first)
7. Validation (which agent checks this phase)

Phases to include (in this exact logical order):
1. Backend Foundations & Environment Setup
2. Neon PostgreSQL Database Connection & Session
3. JWT Verification Middleware & Dependencies
4. SQLModel Task Model & Schema
5. Core Task CRUD Routes (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
6. Toggle Complete Endpoint
7. Query Params Support (status filter, sorting)
8. Error Handling & HTTP Exceptions
9. OpenAPI Documentation & Final Polish
10. Full Backend Integration & Security Validation

Final output format:
- Clean numbered list of 10 phases
- End with a one-line summary: "Execute this plan in sequence to get a bulletproof backend ready for frontend connection."
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the secure and production-ready backend. The plan includes:

1. 10 detailed phases with specific objectives, tasks, agent assignments, dependencies, and validation steps
2. Research document with technology decisions and alternatives
3. Data model specification for the Task entity
4. Quickstart guide for developers
5. API contract in YAML format
6. Agent context updated with new technologies

The plan follows the project constitution and feature specification, ensuring proper user isolation, JWT authentication, and security measures. Each phase has clear dependencies and validation steps to ensure successful implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan created for backend development
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/api-contract.yaml
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all security and architectural requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All planning artifacts completed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation phase
