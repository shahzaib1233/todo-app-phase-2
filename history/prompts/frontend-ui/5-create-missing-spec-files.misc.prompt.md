# Create Missing Spec Files

## Prompt Text
```
Dear in the folder specs/1-frontend-ui/ there is data-model.md quickstart.md research.md file is missing please check if they are required
```

## Response Text
Created the three missing specification files for the frontend UI project:
1. data-model.md - Defines the frontend data models, interfaces, and state structures for the application
2. research.md - Documents the research and technical decisions made during planning, including technology choices and implementation strategies
3. quickstart.md - Provides a comprehensive guide to set up, run, and begin developing the frontend UI application

These files complete the full set of specification documents needed for the Professional & Beautiful Frontend UI for Phase II Todo Web App project.
